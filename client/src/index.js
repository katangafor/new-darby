  GOOD CALENDAR COMPONENT

  Next steps
    - load all the pics up
    - change snippet on front page
    - buttons on left should be position: 'fixed' and have a spacer div underneath, and clicking should scroll to top

  Big fixes
    - on mobile, the footer is bigger than the body of the whole page

  Nice-to-haves:
    - this fricking udemy course plssss https://www.udemy.com/course/svg-animation/
    - here's a lil svg article course https://www.creativebloq.com/features/the-complete-guide-to-svg/2
    - react-big-calendar doesn't look bad for darbyPix
    - an SVG logo would let me do dope ass anime line drawing on it

  So maybe firebase wasn't the whole problem: https://github.com/neptunian/react-photo-gallery/issues/157
